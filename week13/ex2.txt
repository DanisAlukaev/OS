Task 2.

Strategies of dealing with deadlocks:
1. Recovery.
	Certain modification of this strategy involves killing the process, which for some processes cannot be applicable. 
	Also, the Recovery through Rollback requires writing process' state to a file, and such a memory consumption might
	be impermissible.
2. Prevention.
	Prevention strategy implies the following scenarios for different cases so that deadlocks cannot happen. There were 
	described four basic conditions: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait. The main problem 
	that might occur is the inability to parallelism due to resource allocation constraints.
3. Avoidance.
	This strategy might be used if there is available information about the required resources for each process. In this
	case, the system is able to decide whether granting a resource is safe or not. 
	In order to determine the state to which request leads the Banker's algorithm can be applied. This algorithm relatively
	effective, so avoidance becomes more advantageous compared to other strategies.
