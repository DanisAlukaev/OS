Create the file _ex3.txt:
$ nano _ex3.txt

Remove execute permission for everybody, i.e., grant permission to execute for nobody:
$ chmod -x _ex3.txt
$ ls -l _ex3.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 danis danis 0 окт 20 15:33 _ex3.txt

Grant all permissions to owner and others (not group):
$ chmod 707 _ex3.txt
$ ls -l _ex3.txt
-rwx---rwx 1 danis danis 0 окт 20 15:33 _ex3.txt

Make group permissions equal to user permissions:
$ chmod g=u _ex3.txt
$ ls -l _ex3.txt
-rwxrwxrwx 1 danis danis 0 окт 20 15:33 _ex3.txt

$ ls -l _ex3.txt
-rw-rw---- 1 danis danis 0 окт 20 15:33 _ex3.txt

$ ls -l _ex3.txt
-rwxrwxr-x 1 danis danis 0 окт 20 15:33 _ex3.txt

3. 777 can be treated as -rwxrwxrwx, meaning that for owner, group and others granted all permissions (read, write, execute).
