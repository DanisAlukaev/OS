Let the number of page frames is N.

The number of Hits will be maximized when the sequence of references has the form: 0, 1, 2, ... , N-1, any subset of Powerset of {0,1,2,3 ... N-1}. 
In such a case the Hit/Miss Ratio is (cardinality of a subset of Powerset)/N, so for the Hit/Miss Ratio to be greater than 1, the cardinality 
of chosen subset should be greater than N. Specifically, one might take the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 with Hit/Miss Ratio 6/5.

The number of Misses will be maximized when the sequence of references has the form: 0, 1, 2, ... , N-1. In fact, misses will occur for each reference, 
so the Hit/Miss Ratio is always 0/N. For instance, this sequence can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 with Hit/Miss Ratio 0/5.
