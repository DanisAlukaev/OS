The physical address points to the real memory location in Random-access memory (RAM). Apparently, only the
the programs that are currently being executed are placed in RAM. However, often it cannot contain all the programs
to be executed, so arrises the problem of program accomodation.
In fact, the virtual addressing resolve this issue by secondary memory usage. During compilation of program CPU assigns
virtual address to it. This address refers to the address space of correspondent process. At the execution time virtual  
addresses mapped to the physical addresses.
