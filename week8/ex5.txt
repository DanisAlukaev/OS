Task 5.

The physical address points to the real memory location in Random-access memory (RAM). In fact, only the programs 
that are currently being executed are placed in RAM. However, often it cannot contain all the programs to be executed, 
so arrises the problem of program accommodation.
Indeed, the virtual addressing resolves this issue, because virtual addresses (VA) can be larger than physical addresses as VA is 
purely logical. During the compilation of the program, CPU creates and assigns a VA to it. This address refers to the address space 
of the corresponding process. At the execution time, VAs are mapped to the physical addresses by Memory Management Unit (MMU).
