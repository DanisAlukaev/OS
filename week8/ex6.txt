Task 6.

Since the machine has 8KB pages and we must be able to access every address within the page, 13 bits of an address will 
be given for the offset (8KB = 8192bit = 2^(13)bit).
By definition the machine has a 16-bit virtual address, so to encode the number of page frame there available 16-13 = 3bits.
Consequently, for a single-level linear page table needed 2^(3) = 8 entries.

Answer: for a single-level linear page table needed 8 entries.
