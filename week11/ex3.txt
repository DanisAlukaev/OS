// Task 3.

The first code snippet produces the string "Hello" as an output twice. Since the '\n' symbol flushes the content of buffer, 
and in the first program, we do not have it before the fork() unlike the second one, the buffer will contain the string "Hello." 
Consequently, the system call fork() created a child process holding this buffer, and it was printed again.
In contrast, in the second case, the buffer was cleared before the fork and, therefore, only one "Hello" was printed.
