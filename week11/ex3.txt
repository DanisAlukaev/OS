Preliminaries: function printf() has a buffer, and the content of this buffer is flushed after the '\n' symbol appeared in a sequence
of characters.
The first code snippet produces the string "Hello\n" as an output twice. Since we do not have a '\n' symbol before the fork(), the buffer
will contain the string "Hello" after the forking. Consequently, the system call fork() created a child process holding this buffer, and 
then both buffers were flushed, and both processes printed "Hello\n".
In contrast, in the second case, the buffer was flushed before the fork(). Therefore, both parent and child processes had an empty buffer 
after the forking. As a result, the "Hello\n\n\n" was printed.
